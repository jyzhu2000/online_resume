<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing and gaming! On any given evening after work, you can usually find me shouting from the 
    top of a bouldering wall at the Cliffs or tapping away at some visually-stunning game at home (currently playing Honkai Star Rail!). 
    I also enjoy baking a lemon tart on occasion, producing a decadant chocolate cake for a birthday on request, and have been dubbed 
    the 'bread supplier' by my old martial arts club. I hope to try out new activities like dance or pottery in the future as well!
